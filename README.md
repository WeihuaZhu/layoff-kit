# layoff-kit

a first-aid kit of action items if unfortunately laid off, just in case.

Action Items:

- try to negotiate on extending the last day as soon as possible.
- make sure to submit information/form to the layoffs.fyi site. So my linkedin, resume, level informations can be found in the google sheet link in layoffs.fyi.
- set linkedin to open-to-work status, visibility set as visible to recruiters + all people.
- write a linkedin post on sharing the news, and let friends repost/comment for better reach. Things to cover in the post

1. visa status, e.g. in H1B status, need to land the next job within 60 days period.
2. Current location, open to what locations and any remote positions
3. years of experience, prodest work, recent work, skillsets
4. contact information
5. hashtags, #layoffs, #xxxlayoffs, #engineer, etc.
